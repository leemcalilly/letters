			<h4>"The Country Club Sandwiches"</h4>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V1</h5>
				<p>It's early-evenin' Tuesday night, 'bout 7ben - 8 o'clock</p>
				<p>And I'm headin' to the honky tonk to get a little hot.</p>
				<p>When I busted through the swangin' door well whom all did I hear?</p>
				<p>It 'twas the Country Club a-Sammiches gettin' into gear!</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>Chorus</h5>
				<p>They's the Country Club a' Sammiches and Lordy how they swing!</p>
				<p>They's the Country Club a' Sammiches and can't you hear 'em sing?</p>
				<p>They sing, "Billy-Bobby, Dave 'n Robby Jimmy-John and Bob!</p>
				<p>We's the Country Club a' Sammiches, come get us while we're hot!"</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<h5>Guitar Break</h5>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V2</h5>
				<p>Well it didn't take me long to get my dayncin' shoes on tight</p>
				<p>And the jelly from the sammich band was fillin' me just right.</p>
				<p>I said, "Howdy boys, I came from town - I heard you're good with cheese?"</p>
				<p>They said, "Step up to our counter son we'll fill your gut with ease!"</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<h5>Chorus</h5>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>Bridge</h5>
				<p>Well it sure do take a polished man to blend a meal just so,</p>
				<p>But these old boys from Deliville can make you doe-si-doe.</p>
				<p>With their market fresh ingredients of country, rock and soul,</p>
				<p>Their ain't a palate near or far that can resist their roooooooooooool!<p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V3</h5>
				<p>By the time the boys were finally done my spirit was restored,</p>
				<p>And the gal I had across my arm, her feets was mighty sore!</p>
				<p>But the yummy-comfort deli feeling lingered on and on,</p>
				<p>And as I drifted off to sleep I heard their tasty song!</p>

			<h4>"Last Night the Bottle Came to Town"</h4>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V1</h5>
				<p>Last night the bottle came to town</p>
				<p>Whiskey was my only friend around</p>
				<p>Inside a bar where no one's found</p>
				<p>A drink poured neat kept me safe and sound</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V2</h5>
				<p>I used to never run around</p>
				<p>Cause you were the only game in town</p>
				<p>You were closer than my kin</p>
				<p>But now I drink alone again</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>Chorus</h5>
				<p>And the only thing to do</p>
				<p>Is pour another one for you</p>
				<p>There's nothing you could say</p>
				<p>To make this pain go away</p>
				<p>Last night the bottle came to town</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<h5>Solo</h5>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V3</h5>
				<p>I saved my mama's wedding ring</p>
				<p>Now that doesn't mean a thing</p>
				<p>All the that time all those plans</p>
				<p>Now it'll never touch your hand</p>

			<h4>"If He Breaks Your Heart"</h4>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>Chorus</h5>
				<p>If he breaks your heart...can I lick the wound?</p>
				<p>I've tried to keep my distance, settin' here across the room.</p>
				<p>I can see it in his face, he'll be leavin' you so soon,</p>
				<p>So when he breaks your heart, can I lick the wound?</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V1</h5>
				<p>The two of you walked in here hand in hand,</p>
				<p>But when the band stopped playin' he got mad.</p>
				<p>You've tried to calm him down, leadin' him towards the door.</p>
				<p>But his face is turnin' red, and he wants to settle a score.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<h5>Chorus</h5>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
			<h5>V2</h5>
				<p>Sometimes a man gets set in his ways,</p>
				<p>And yours looks he's had one of those days.</p>
				<p>He wanted one more song, but the band refused to play.</p>
				<p>So he broke off his bottle, and walked up towards the stage.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<h5>Guitar Solo</h5>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
			<h5>V3</h5>
				<p>That drummer seen him comin', and guessed his ruse.</p>
				<p>But your man was whiskey-bent with nothin' to lose.</p>
				<p>He put his finger to the drummer's chest...and you can prolly guess the rest.</p>
				<p>His bloodied mouth was facin' North, and his crooked nose was facin' West!</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>Chorus</h5>
				<p>If he breaks your heart...can I lick the wound?</p>
				<p>I've tried to keep my distance, settin' here across the room.</p>
				<p>I can see it in his face, he'll be walkin' out on you,</p>
				<p>So when he breaks your heart, can I lick the wound?</p>

			<h4>"Just a String on His Guitar"</h4>
			<p>* Note: David Jennings objected to the use of the Maj7 chord at the end of this song, but the producer demanded it.</p>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V1</h5>
				<p>She was gone again this mornin' and I know exactly where she's bound.</p>
				<p>Last night there were promises, but now her picture's all that's found</p>
				<p>Where her boots were laid at midnight there's an emptiness I know</p>
				<p>He's got a gig tonight in Reno and she'll be waitin' at the show.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>Chorus</h5>
				<p>'Cause he's the one who winds her</p>
				<p>And he don't really mind her</p>
				<p>He cuts her when she gets too long,</p>
				<p>I clean her when her welcome's warn</p>
				<p>He plays her every night, makes a dollar in his jar.</p>
				<p>Just a string on his guitar, good Lord, just a string on his guitar.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="verse">
				<h5>V2</h5>
				<p>Monday morning comes and she's back to me again</p>
				<p>Says not a word about it, just quietly walks on in.</p>
				<p>There's a silent understanding, between her soul and mine,</p>
				<p>And though we lie together, it's only me who cries.</p>
